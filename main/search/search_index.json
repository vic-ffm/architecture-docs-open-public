Project Scope: ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 Base Deployment on Azure","text":"<p>The scope of this plan is the deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise version 11.4 on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, establishing what Esri terms as \"base deployment.\" The project scope is precisely defined to ensure a focused and methodical implementation, laying a robust foundation for future enhancements and the integration of more advanced capabilities.</p> <p>The core components included within this base deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 are:</p> <ol> <li>Portal for ArcGIS: The central web-based interface for managing and sharing geospatial content, users, and services.</li> <li>ArcGIS Server: A single ArcGIS Server site federated with Portal for ArcGIS and designated as the primary \"hosting server.\" This component is responsible for publishing web services and performing spatial analysis.</li> <li>ArcGIS Data Store: The Relational data store type is mandatory and will be deployed. In the new eMap platform, its role is strictly limited to supporting the hosting server's requirements for Portal-hosted feature layers (e.g., features created in Map Viewer) and outputs from Portal's spatial analysis tools. It is not intended as the primary repository for enterprise geodata.</li> <li>ArcGIS Web Adaptors: Two instances of the ArcGIS Web Adaptor will be deployed per environment:<ul> <li>One configured for Portal for ArcGIS.</li> <li>One configured for the ArcGIS Server site. These Web Adaptors will be hosted on Azure App Service (Linux runtime with Tomcat), leveraging Azure's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) capabilities for web application hosting.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>This deployment will be exclusively within the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, with a strong emphasis on utilising Azure PaaS offerings where feasible and aligned with enterprise architectural principles. The specific Azure PaaS services integral to this base deployment include:</p> <ul> <li>Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Flexible Server): With the PostGIS extension enabled, this will serve as the user-managed Enterprise Geodatabase for authoritative, curated enterprise spatial data.</li> <li>Azure Blob Storage: Utilised for:<ul> <li>The Portal for ArcGIS <code>content</code> directory.</li> <li>Storing map and image service tile caches (the <code>arcgiscache</code> directory, registered as a cloud store).</li> <li>ArcGIS Server <code>jobs</code> and <code>output</code> directories (registered as a cloud store).</li> <li>Storing <code>webgisdr</code> backup files.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLSg2): Designated as the user-managed Raster Store, employing cloud-optimised formats such as Cloud Raster Format (CRF) and Meta Raster Format (MRF).</li> <li>Azure Files: Provisioned for the ArcGIS Server <code>config-store</code> and <code>system</code> directories, providing shared file access for the server site.</li> </ul> <p>The project encompasses the setup of three distinct environments:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Development (DEV) and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environments:</p> <ul> <li>Core ArcGIS Enterprise components (Portal for ArcGIS, ArcGIS Server, and ArcGIS Data Store) will be deployed on separate, dedicated Azure Virtual Machines (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) per component, within each environment and region. This architectural structure mirrors the Production environment to ensure consistency in deployment and testing. Cost optimisation for these non-production settings will be achieved through the utilisation of lower Azure VM SKUs, reduced instance counts (e.g., for ArcGIS Server, typically a single instance rather than a VM Scale Set), and the omission of High Availability (HA) or Disaster Recovery (DR) configurations.</li> <li>ArcGIS Web Adaptors will be hosted on Azure App Service instances configured with lower-specification, cost-effective App Service Plans.</li> <li>Azure PaaS resources (e.g., Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files, Azure ADLS Gen2) for DEV and UAT will consist of dedicated, separate instances for each environment. Cost-optimisation principles will be adhered to by provisioning these dedicated PaaS resources with lower service tiers, reduced redundancy levels (e.g., Locally-Redundant Storage - LRS), and smaller quotas compared to the Production environment.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Production (PROD) Environment:</p> <ul> <li>A multi-tier architecture will be implemented for enhanced performance, scalability, and resilience.</li> <li>Portal for ArcGIS will be deployed on a dedicated Azure VM (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).</li> <li>ArcGIS Server will be deployed using Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, enabling horizontal scalability. The initial base deployment will configure a minimum of one instance.</li> <li>ArcGIS Data Store (Relational) will be deployed on a dedicated Azure VM (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).</li> <li>ArcGIS Web Adaptors will be hosted on Azure App Service instances with App Service Plans appropriately sized for production loads.</li> <li>Azure PaaS resources will be fully dedicated, separate, high-tier services configured with appropriate redundancy options (e.g., Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS), Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Geographically, the Production environment will initially be deployed in the Azure Australia Southeast (Melbourne) region as part of the base deployment (MVP Stage of the Phased Implementation Plan). The architecture is designed to support future replication and disaster recovery capabilities in the Azure Australia East (Sydney) region.</p> <p>Automation is a cornerstone of this project's scope:</p> <ul> <li>All Azure infrastructure provisioning will be automated using OpenTofu (Infrastructure as Code).</li> <li>Virtual Machine configuration, including operating system setup (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) and ArcGIS software installation, will be automated using Configuration Management tool.</li> <li>Foundational Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) will be established for validating and deploying IaC and CM code.</li> </ul> <p>The following elements are explicitly out of scope for this base deployment:</p> <ul> <li>Advanced ArcGIS Enterprise server roles such as GeoEvent Server, Image Server (beyond the configuration of the Raster Store with ADLSg2), GeoAnalytics Server, Knowledge Server, or Mission Server. These may be considered in future project phases.</li> <li>Deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise using Kubernetes.</li> <li>Utilisation of Esri's Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings such as ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Platform cloud services, beyond their potential use as external data sources if required.</li> <li>The full implementation of High Availability (HA) configurations (e.g., active-passive Portal, primary-standby ArcGIS Data Store) and inter-region Disaster Recovery (DR) mechanisms in the initial base deployment. The base deployment focuses on establishing core functionality in the primary region (Melbourne) and is architected to facilitate the addition of HA/DR in subsequent stages.</li> </ul>","tags":["ArcGIS","eMap","Introduction","Project Scope","Objectives"]},{"location":"emap/01/#14-key-objectives-and-business-benefits-of-the-new-emap-platform","title":"1.4.
