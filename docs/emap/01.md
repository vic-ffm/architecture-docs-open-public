## 1.1. Purpose of This Document

This document provides the detailed implementation plan for the deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise version 11.4 on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. This initiative, "The new eMap Platform", aims to establish a modernised, resilient, and scalable enterprise Geographic Information System (GIS) platform.

The primary purpose of this plan is to establish a clear approach for deploying ArcGIS Enterprise in Azure whilst adhering to cloud-native principles. This plan moves beyond treating ArcGIS as a proprietary "black box" and instead positions it as a standard application server within the broader enterprise architecture landscape.

The intent of this plan is to furnish the technical teams—comprising Cloud Infrastructure Engineers, Cloud Security Specialists, and GIS Engineers—with comprehensive instructions, architectural specifications, and operational guidance necessary for the successful execution of this deployment.

The plan details:

- **Architectural Foundations**: Core principles guiding the implementation, including cloud-native design, separation of concerns, and data sovereignty
- **Technical Architecture**: Detailed specifications for infrastructure components, network topology, data storage allocation, and security controls
- **Implementation Methodology**: A phased approach to building the solution, beginning with data governance and progressing through increasingly sophisticated technical implementations
- **Operational Framework**: Guidance for ongoing management, monitoring, and optimisation of the platform
- **Migration Strategy**: Approach for transitioning from existing systems to the new architecture


Throughout this plan, emphasis is placed on leveraging Azure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings, implementing robust automation via Infrastructure as Code (OpenTofu) and Configuration Management, and establishing clear data governance principles that maintain control of enterprise data through user-managed platforms rather than proprietary systems.

## 1.2. Target Audience and How to Use This Plan

This implementation plan is specifically designed for the technical teams responsible for the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of the new eMap platform. The primary audience comprises:

### 1.2.1. Target Audience

The primary audience for this document comprises three key groups of technical professionals:

*   **Cloud Infrastructure Engineers (DevOps)**: This group possess expertise in Microsoft Azure services, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methodologies, specifically using OpenTofu, and Configuration Management (CM) principles. Their core responsibilities will involve provisioning and managing the Azure infrastructure, implementing automation pipelines, and ensuring the operational stability and scalability of the platform. This plan provides detailed specifications for Azure resource configuration, network architecture, automation scripts, and the deployment of compute and storage resources.

*   **Cloud Security Specialists**: These specialists are responsible for ensuring the security and compliance of the new eMap platform. A strong understanding of Azure security services (e.g., Web Application Firewall, Network Security Groups, Azure Key Vault, Microsoft Entra ID, Managed Identities) and Zero Trust security principles is essential. This document will guide them in implementing robust security controls, identity and access management strategies, network security configurations, and data protection measures detailed throughout the plan.

*   **GIS Engineers**: This group brings extensive experience with traditional Esri ArcGIS Server environments and Microsoft SQL Server. For the new eMap project, their focus will be on developing GIS Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, building geospatial workflows using VertiGIS Studio Workflow, publishing services, and managing enterprise geodata. Recognising that modern cloud paradigms, DevOps practices, and PostgreSQL databases may be new areas, this plan is structured to facilitate their transition. It details the shift to cloud-native data management using Azure Database for PostgreSQL, outlines new workflow development patterns, and describes the automated operational model. Sections on data governance (Part II), user-managed enterprise data strategies, and ArcGIS component configuration (Part III, Part V) will be particularly pertinent.

### 1.2.2. How to Use This Plan

This document is structured to serve as a central reference and detailed playbook for all involved teams. To maximise its utility, team members are encouraged to approach it as follows:

1.  **Familiarisation with Core Concepts**: All team members should begin by thoroughly reviewing Part I: Foundation & Strategic Overview and Part II: Guiding Principles & Modernisation Approach. These sections establish the project's objectives, core architectural principles (such as Azure PaaS First, ArcGIS as a Standard Application Server, Automation via OpenTofu and Configuration Management), and the strategic rationale behind the new eMap initiative.

2.  **Role-Specific Deep Dives**:
    *   **Cloud Infrastructure Engineers** will find detailed guidance in Part III (Technical Implementation), Part V (Architectural Deep Dives, particularly Section 16: Automation Strategy), and relevant sections within Part IV (Monitoring, Operations, and Cost Management).
    *   **Cloud Security Specialists** should focus on security-centric sections throughout the document, with particular emphasis on Part V (Section 17: Security) and relevant networking and identity configurations within Part III and Part V.
    *   **GIS Engineers** will benefit significantly from Part II (Data Governance Framework), Part V (Section 15.3: Data Tier Detailed Design, focusing on Azure Database for PostgreSQL and data migration), Part VI (Developer & User Guidance, especially Section 19: VertiGIS Studio Workflow Development Guidelines), and sections in Part III detailing ArcGIS software configuration and service publishing.

3.  **Phased Implementation Guidance**: The plan is organised around a phased implementation approach (detailed in Part III ). Teams should consult the sections relevant to the current phase of the project, ensuring deliverables and objectives for each stage are clearly understood and met.

4.  **Cross-Functional Collaboration and Learning**: Given the diverse expertise within the team and the introduction of new technologies and methodologies for some members, this document is intended to foster a shared understanding. For instance, GIS Engineers are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the automation strategies (Part V, Section 16) to understand the new operational paradigm, while Cloud Infrastructure and Security Engineers should understand the data governance principles (Part II) that drive many architectural decisions.

5.  **Reference for Best Practices and Standards**: The plan incorporates Esri and Microsoft Azure best practices. It should be used as the authoritative source for approved configurations, deployment standards, and operational procedures for the new eMap platform. The appendices (Part VII) provide supplementary information, including checklists and configuration snippets, intended to aid in practical implementation.

6.  **Living Document**: This plan will continue to be further refined as the project progresses and new insights are gained. Updates will be managed through version control, and significant changes will be communicated to all stakeholders.

## 1.3. Project Scope: ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 Base Deployment on Azure

The scope of this plan is the deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise version 11.4 on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, establishing what Esri terms as "base deployment." The project scope is precisely defined to ensure a focused and methodical implementation, laying a robust foundation for future enhancements and the integration of more advanced capabilities.

The core components included within this base deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise 11.4 are:

1.  **Portal for ArcGIS**: The central web-based interface for managing and sharing geospatial content, users, and services.
2.  **ArcGIS Server**: A single ArcGIS Server site federated with Portal for ArcGIS and designated as the primary "hosting server." This component is responsible for publishing web services and performing spatial analysis.
3.  **ArcGIS Data Store**: The Relational data store type is mandatory and will be deployed. In the new eMap platform, its role is strictly limited to supporting the hosting server's requirements for Portal-hosted feature layers (e.g., features created in Map Viewer) and outputs from Portal's spatial analysis tools. It is **not** intended as the primary repository for enterprise geodata.
4.  **ArcGIS Web Adaptors**: Two instances of the ArcGIS Web Adaptor will be deployed per environment:
    *   One configured for Portal for ArcGIS.
    *   One configured for the ArcGIS Server site.
    These Web Adaptors will be hosted on **Azure App Service** (Linux runtime with Tomcat), leveraging Azure's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) capabilities for web application hosting.

This deployment will be exclusively within the **Microsoft Azure cloud platform**, with a strong emphasis on utilising Azure PaaS offerings where feasible and aligned with enterprise architectural principles. The specific Azure PaaS services integral to this base deployment include:

*   **Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Flexible Server)**: With the PostGIS extension enabled, this will serve as the *user-managed* Enterprise Geodatabase for authoritative, curated enterprise spatial data.
*   **Azure Blob Storage**: Utilised for:
    *   The Portal for ArcGIS `content` directory.
    *   Storing map and image service tile caches (the `arcgiscache` directory, registered as a cloud store).
    *   ArcGIS Server `jobs` and `output` directories (registered as a cloud store).
    *   Storing `webgisdr` backup files.
*   **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLSg2)**: Designated as the *user-managed* Raster Store, employing cloud-optimised formats such as Cloud Raster Format (CRF) and Meta Raster Format (MRF).
*   **Azure Files**: Provisioned for the ArcGIS Server `config-store` and `system` directories, providing shared file access for the server site.

The project encompasses the setup of three distinct environments:

*   **Development (DEV) and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environments**:
    *   Core ArcGIS Enterprise components (Portal for ArcGIS, ArcGIS Server, and ArcGIS Data Store) will be deployed on separate, dedicated Azure Virtual Machines (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) per component, within each environment and region. This architectural structure mirrors the Production environment to ensure consistency in deployment and testing. Cost optimisation for these non-production settings will be achieved through the utilisation of lower Azure VM SKUs, reduced instance counts (e.g., for ArcGIS Server, typically a single instance rather than a VM Scale Set), and the omission of High Availability (HA) or Disaster Recovery (DR) configurations.
    *   ArcGIS Web Adaptors will be hosted on Azure App Service instances configured with lower-specification, cost-effective App Service Plans.
    *   Azure PaaS resources (e.g., Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files, Azure ADLS Gen2) for DEV and UAT will consist of dedicated, separate instances for each environment. Cost-optimisation principles will be adhered to by provisioning these dedicated PaaS resources with lower service tiers, reduced redundancy levels (e.g., Locally-Redundant Storage - LRS), and smaller quotas compared to the Production environment.

*   **Production (PROD) Environment**:
    *   A multi-tier architecture will be implemented for enhanced performance, scalability, and resilience.
    *   Portal for ArcGIS will be deployed on a dedicated Azure VM (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
    *   ArcGIS Server will be deployed using Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, enabling horizontal scalability. The initial base deployment will configure a minimum of one instance.
    *   ArcGIS Data Store (Relational) will be deployed on a dedicated Azure VM (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
    *   ArcGIS Web Adaptors will be hosted on Azure App Service instances with App Service Plans appropriately sized for production loads.
    *   Azure PaaS resources will be fully dedicated, separate, high-tier services configured with appropriate redundancy options (e.g., Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS), Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)).

Geographically, the Production environment will initially be deployed in the **Azure Australia Southeast (Melbourne)** region as part of the base deployment (MVP Stage of the Phased Implementation Plan). The architecture is designed to support future replication and disaster recovery capabilities in the **Azure Australia East (Sydney)** region.

Automation is a cornerstone of this project's scope:

*   All Azure infrastructure provisioning will be automated using **OpenTofu** (Infrastructure as Code).
*   Virtual Machine configuration, including operating system setup (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) and ArcGIS software installation, will be automated using Configuration Management tool.
*   Foundational Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) will be established for validating and deploying IaC and CM code.

The following elements are explicitly **out of scope** for this base deployment:

*   Advanced ArcGIS Enterprise server roles such as GeoEvent Server, Image Server (beyond the configuration of the Raster Store with ADLSg2), GeoAnalytics Server, Knowledge Server, or Mission Server. These may be considered in future project phases.
*   Deployment of ArcGIS Enterprise using Kubernetes.
*   Utilisation of Esri's Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings such as ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Platform cloud services, beyond their potential use as external data sources if required.
*   The full implementation of High Availability (HA) configurations (e.g., active-passive Portal, primary-standby ArcGIS Data Store) and inter-region Disaster Recovery (DR) mechanisms in the initial base deployment. The base deployment focuses on establishing core functionality in the primary region (Melbourne) and is architected to facilitate the addition of HA/DR in subsequent stages.

## 1.4. Key Objectives and Business Benefits of the New eMap Platform

The new eMap platform is architected to be a significant advancement over legacy systems, leveraging modern cloud capabilities and adhering to stringent enterprise architectural principles.

The primary objectives of the new eMap platform are:

1.  **Platform Modernisation and Cloud-Native Integration:**
    *   **Objective:** Transition from traditional infrastructure paradigms to a modern, cloud-native architecture by primarily utilising Azure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings. This includes deploying ArcGIS Web Adaptors on Azure App Service, leveraging Azure Database for PostgreSQL for enterprise geodatabases, and using Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and Azure Files for specialised storage needs. ArcGIS Enterprise itself will be treated as a standard application server, aligning its management with other enterprise applications.
    *   **Rationale:** Reduces the operational burden of managing underlying infrastructure (OS patching, runtime updates), enhances deployment agility, and ensures the platform benefits from Azure's continuous innovation in its PaaS landscape.

2.  **Enhanced Scalability and Performance:**
    *   **Objective:** Engineer a platform capable of dynamically scaling to meet fluctuating user demand and processing requirements. This involves employing Azure VM Scale Sets for the ArcGIS Server tier in Production, configuring Azure App Service for scalable Web Adaptor hosting, and utilising appropriate performance tiers for Azure PaaS data services.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures consistent application responsiveness, supports future growth in data volume and user load, and optimises resource consumption by scaling resources according to need.

3.  **Improved Resilience and Business Continuity:**
    *   **Objective:** Establish a highly available (HA) architecture within the primary Azure region (Australia Southeast - Melbourne) and a robust disaster recovery (DR) capability to a secondary Azure region (Australia East - Sydney). This is achieved through multi-Availability Zone deployments, Azure PaaS data replication (e.g., PostgreSQL cross-region replicas, Geo-Redundant Storage), and a Global Server Load Balancer (GSLB) for automated regional failover.
    *   **Rationale:** Minimises service downtime in the event of component failures or regional outages, safeguards enterprise data, and ensures continuity of critical GIS services, thereby reducing business disruption.

4.  **Implementation of a Robust and Modern Security Posture:**
    *   **Objective:** Secure the platform using a layered defence strategy based on Zero Trust principles. This includes using a Web Application Firewall (WAF), Application Delivery Controller (ADC), Network Security Groups (NSGs) for micro-segmentation, Azure Key Vault for secrets management, Azure Managed Identities for resource authentication, and integrating with the enterprise Identity Provider (IdP) via SAML/OpenID Connect for Single Sign-On.
    *   **Rationale:** Protects sensitive geospatial data and services from unauthorised access and cyber threats, ensures compliance with enterprise security policies, and provides a secure environment for users and integrations.

5.  **Streamlined Operations through Comprehensive Automation:**
    *   **Objective:** Automate the provisioning of all Azure infrastructure using OpenTofu (Infrastructure as Code) and the configuration of Virtual Machines using Configuration Management tool. Establish Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for managing and deploying these automation scripts.
    *   **Rationale:** Increases deployment speed and consistency, significantly reduces the potential for manual configuration errors, enhances operational efficiency by freeing up technical staff from repetitive tasks, and allows for rapid, reliable environment rebuilds and modifications.

6.  **Optimised Cost Management and Resource Utilisation:**
    *   **Objective:** Achieve cost-efficiency through strategic use of Azure PaaS, auto-scaling mechanisms, appropriate selection of Azure service tiers (especially for DEV/UAT environments), Azure Reservations or Savings Plans for Production compute, and diligent monitoring of resource consumption via Azure Cost Management.
    *   **Rationale:** Lowers the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) compared to traditional on-premises deployments or less optimised cloud architectures, ensures efficient use of cloud resources, and provides predictable expenditure.

7.  **Strengthened Data Governance and User-Managed Data Control:**
    *   **Objective:** Implement a clear data governance framework where authoritative enterprise data resides in user-managed Azure Database for PostgreSQL instances, registered as Enterprise Geodatabases. The Esri-managed ArcGIS Data Store will be limited to supporting Portal-hosted feature layers and analysis outputs. Data lifecycle management will be performed using native DBMS tools.
    *   **Rationale:** Enhances data integrity, quality, and control by empowering data stewards with direct management capabilities. It promotes open, standardised data access and simplifies integration with other enterprise data systems.

Achieving these objectives will yield significant business benefits, including:

*   **Increased Organisational Agility:** The automated and modernised platform enables quicker deployment of new GIS capabilities and services, allowing the Department to respond more rapidly to emergencies and changing requirements.
*   **Reduced Operational Risk and Downtime:** Enhanced resilience (HA/DR) and robust security measures directly translate to fewer service disruptions and a lower risk profile for critical GIS operations.
*   **Improved Decision-Making:** Reliable, performant, and readily accessible geospatial data and services provide a stronger foundation for data-driven decision-making across the Department.
*   **Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** The combination of PaaS utilisation, automation, and optimised resource consumption contributes to a more cost-effective GIS platform over its lifecycle.
*   **Enhanced Innovation Capability and Future-Readiness:** A modern, scalable, and standards-aligned platform simplifies integration with emerging technologies (e.g., AI/ML, Big Data analytics) and facilitates easier adoption of future ArcGIS enhancements.
*   **Improved Developer and User Experience:** Standardised environments, automated processes, and a performant platform improve the productivity and satisfaction of both GIS developers and end-users.
*   **Greater Control and Transparency over Enterprise Data Assets:** The "User Managed" data approach, coupled with a clear governance framework, provides better visibility, control, and management of valuable enterprise geospatial data.

Theis architecture is designed not merely as a technology upgrade but as a strategic enabler that will provide a more agile, resilient, secure, and cost-effective enterprise GIS platform, capable of supporting the evolving needs of the Department and our users.
